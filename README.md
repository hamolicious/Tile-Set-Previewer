# Tile-Set-Previewer
A Tile Set Previewer written in Python 3.8 and PyGame, used to live preview tile creation in a context window.

<br>
When you launch the <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Tile-Set-Previewer/blob/master/main.py">main.py</a> file, you will first enter edit mode, use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to choose the tile you want to place down, (when finished) hit ENTER to launch preview mode, open the tiles in your favourite editor and start editing, save the image to automatically update the tiles. The <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Tile-Set-Previewer/blob/master/settings.json">settings.json</a> contains some settings that you can edit to customize the window. I suggest copying the <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Tile-Set-Previewer/tree/master/Tiles">Tiles</a> folder to not lose the tiles that come with the software because they are neccesary, later, you can copy the new Tiles folder path and paste it under "tiles-path" in the <a href="https://github.com/hamolicious/Tile-Set-Previewer/blob/master/settings.json">settings.json</a> file.
